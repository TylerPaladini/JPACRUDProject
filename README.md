##Week Eight Skill Distillery SpringMVC Project

##Details:

This Program is utilizing a database to provide the user with a detailed list of North American Pleistocene Megafauna. The user will have the ability to read from the list, create their own megafauna and add it to the database table, update existing data from the table, as well as delete from it. The program is uploaded to Amazon Web Services allowing the user to access it from a browser.

Technologies Used:
Java
Spring
HTML
CSS
JPA
Gradle
JUnit
TomCat Apache 8.5
Bootstrap
SQL
MySQLWorkbench
Amazon Web Services

##Lessons Learned:

When using setters and getters, ensure that the passed in object and the object being updated are not in the wrong sequence. Utilizing JUnit tests more would diagnose the problem quicker.

##Future Goals:

-Create a better README
-Add styling through CSS to create a program that is visually appealing
-Learn how to attach individual pictures to the different megafauna inside the database
-Complete detailed description in the description field for all Megafauna
